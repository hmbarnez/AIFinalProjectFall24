## Abstract <br>
Purchasing a car represents a significant financial decision for individuals, requiring accurate pricing to ensure informed transactions for both buyers and sellers. However, many buyers often fail to adequately research the factors influencing car prices, 
such as make, model, year, and mileage, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This study presents the development of an AI model designed to predict car prices with high accuracy, using various vehicle attributes to assist users in making data-driven decisions.
<br>
Our AI model was trained to predict car prices using a dataset from Kaggle, a website hosting a vast repository of datasets that are often used to perform data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
