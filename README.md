## Abstract <br>
Purchasing a car represents a significant financial decision for individuals, requiring accurate pricing to ensure informed transactions for both buyers and sellers. However, many buyers often fail to adequately research the factors influencing car prices, 
such as make, model, year, and mileage, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This study presents the development of an AI model designed to predict car prices with high accuracy, using various vehicle attributes to assist users in making data-driven decisions.

Our AI model was trained to predict car prices using a dataset from Kaggle, a website hosting a vast repository of datasets that are often used to perform data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. 
## Project Description
This project is a predictive model for estimating used car prices using a deep learning approach built with TensorFlow and Keras. It involves data preprocessing, neural network model training, and hyperparameter tuning. The model is designed to handle various data processing techniques including label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.
